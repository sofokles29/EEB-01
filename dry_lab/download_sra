# Downloading SRA
## What is the SRA?
**Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is a giant library of raw DNA and RNA sequencing data**

# Purpose
to provide a centralized, publicly accessible repository for storing and sharing raw sequencing data, enabling transparency, reproducibility, and the reuse of genomic data for further research and comparative analyses.

# Function
SRA files are containers for raw sequencing reads. They are highly compressed, hence why we can’t just download fastq files directly. To get data from the SRA, we use two tools:  





# Usage



## What is a fastq file?
Files we get from the sequencing companies that include DNA sequences and the quality score that associates with them
They come in specific 4-line format which includes a header line, a line of sequence, a +, and then the quality scores
prefetch
Downloads .sra files (raw compressed format used by NCBI) → these files are not readable yet
fasterq-dump
Converts .sra files into .fastq files, which are text files of sequencing reads
Each read has a name, DNA sequence, and quality score
