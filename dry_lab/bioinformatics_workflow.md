# RNAseq_analysis_brown_bear_adipose
**Hibernation in brown bears (Ursus arctos) includes major physiological changes, enabling them to endure prolonged periods of fasting and immobility. During hibernation, the bears undergo changes such as reductions in body temperature, metabolic suppression, and temporary insulin resistance. Yet, bears remarkably evade the detrimental health effects associated with prolonged inactivity in humans. This project compares blood samples from brown bears at different time points to investigate gene expression changes associated with hibernation using RNA-sequencing (RNAseq). Identifying genes with significant changes across seasons offers a unique perspective on systemic adaptations, including changes in the immune system and metabolic regulation. The findings from this project have implications for human medicine, including advancements in treating metabolic disorders, identifying mediators of metabolic homeostasis, and potential therapeutic approaches for muscle-wasting diseases.**

**The main goal of this project is to identify which genes change between active and hibernating seasons in adipose (fat) and explore why those changes happen.**
